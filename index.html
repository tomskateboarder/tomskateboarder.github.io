        I currently live in Salt Lake City, Utah near downtown. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Downtown activities I enjoy:
        <ul>
          <li>Samples at breweries.
          <li>Trying new and cool restaurants.
          <li>Looking at interesting stuff while riding bikes.
        </ul>
        </p>

        I spend most of my time at home though. I practice and study code but for breaks, I exercise, I like playing video games and watching Netflix and YouTube.

        I have a digital media minor and a bachelor's degree in graphic design from UVU, but I learned I like solving problems and I'm very analytical. While I can be artistic, I'm noticing my mind being more interested in how things work. Designing is great but developing the life of those designs seems to be much more fulfilling.
        </p>  
        <p>
        Both then and now, my colleagues say I have great work ethic, I'm easy to talk to and work with, I love exchanging direct feedback, I'm a great team player and I have strong leadership skills.

        <p>
          I am a homebody currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah near downtown. I've become very interested in
          software development. I love education, science, history and seeing how these disciplines can help humanity. I
          listen to a lot of podcasts, even more than music, mainly about current events, politics, science, tech and
          people. I like vacations and when I go somewhere else, I mainly enjoy the scenery, architecture, food, culture
          and some activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities I enjoy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trying samples at breweries.
          <li>Trying cool and interesting restaurants.
          <li>Looking at interesting stuff while riding bikes.
        </ul>

        <p>
          I spend most of my time at home practicing and studying code but for breaks, I like
          playing video games and watching streaming movies and TV. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a digital media minor and a bachelor's degree in graphic design from UVU, but I learned I like solving
          problems and I'm very analytical. While I can be artistic, I'm noticing my mind being more interested in how
          things work. Designing is great but developing the life of those designs seems to be much more fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both then and now, my colleagues say I have great work ethic, I'm easy to talk to and work with, I love
          exchanging direct feedback, I'm a great team player and I have strong leadership skills.

            This is my TV app. I built this for people who want to watch TV from any channel and venue they want in just
            one place. I built an app for all Apple devices using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

        <p>
        I am a homebody currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah near downtown. I've become very interested in software development. I love education, science, history and seeing how these disciplines can help humanity. I listen to a lot of podcasts, even more than music, mainly about current events, politics, science, tech and people. I like vacations and when I go somewhere else, I mainly enjoy the scenery, architecture, food, culture and some activities.
        </p>
        <p>
        Activities I enjoy:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trying samples at breweries.
            <li>Trying new and cool restaurants.
            <li>Looking at interesting stuff while riding bikes.
          </ul>

        <p>
        I spend most of my time at home practicing and studying code but for breaks, I do strenuous push-ups, I like playing video games and watching Netflix and YouTube. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I have a digital media minor and a bachelor's degree in graphic design from UVU, but I learned I like solving problems and I'm very analytical. While I can be artistic, I'm noticing my mind being more interested in how things work. Designing is great but developing the life of those designs seems to be much more fulfilling.
        </p>  
        <p>
        Both then and now, my colleagues say I have great work ethic, I'm easy to talk to and work with, I love exchanging direct feedback, I'm a great team player and I have strong leadership skills.
